## Quick start

Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/MelonSpeedruns/BotwRandomizer/releases) section and download the latest built .exe file. Run it, configure it, and enjoy your randomized game!

The BOTW Randomizer expects you to have an extracted copy of the Wii U version of Breath of the Wild, including the following:
- The base game
- The latest update (1.5.0)
- The 2 DLCs

It is also recommended (for now) to use Cemu to play the Randomizer, as it wasn't tested on an actual Wii U console.

## What's randomized

Here's what's randomized with the latest version of the Randomizer:

 - Enemy Types
 - Enemy Levels
 - Enemy Weapons
 - Enemy Arrows
 - Taluses
 - Hinoxes
 - Lynels
 - Overworld & Shrine Weapons
 - Overworld & Shrine Chest Drops
 - Armors in Chests
 - Armor Shops
 - Food Shops
 - Arrow Shops

## How it works

On top of everything above being randomized, the Randomizer changes slightly the goal of the game.

First of all, to enter Ganon, you need the Master Sword. This makes it so you need at least 13 hearts to beat the game.

Secondly, completing shrines doesn't give you Spirit Orbs anymore, so how do you get more hearts?

The answer is simple! Spirit Orbs can now be found throughout Hyrule within it's numerous chests.

There are more Spirit Orbs placed in chests than you need. This is done so runs are shorter and so they don't last for days.

## Contributing
